# My Advent Of Code puzzle solutions

Based on the site [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

Which every december gives an advent calendar, allowing to have fun to solve puzzles.

I decided to solve these in **typescript**.

To concentrate only on the puzzles, i set up a reloading system that executes the last modified ts file and automatically transpiles it to display the result in the console.

    npm run start

But it's also possible to generate the js files.

    npm run build
